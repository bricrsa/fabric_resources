**Prompt** : Note that you need to replace the [Your Search Term Here] with your search phrase or word


Check only the Microsoft Fabric Roadmap pages (https://roadmap.fabric.microsoft.com/?product=administration%2Cgovernanceandsecurity; https://roadmap.fabric.microsoft.com/?product=dataengineering; https://roadmap.fabric.microsoft.com/?product=datafactory; https://roadmap.fabric.microsoft.com/?product=datascience; https://roadmap.fabric.microsoft.com/?product=datawarehouse; https://roadmap.fabric.microsoft.com/?product=fabricdeveloperexperiences; https://roadmap.fabric.microsoft.com/?product=onelake; https://roadmap.fabric.microsoft.com/?product=powerbi; https://roadmap.fabric.microsoft.com/?product=real-timeintelligence; https://roadmap.fabric.microsoft.com/?product=sqldatabase;) for any item that references '[Your Search Term Here]'. Look carefully, the references can be subtle and there may be more than one. Donâ€™t just search for keywords; carefully read through each roadmap item title, hunt like a human would. Search first, then manually verify the roadmap page if nothing is found.
